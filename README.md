# Object-oriented Programming and Design (95-712) Personal Work


This repository contains my work for the Object-Oriented Programming and Design course (95-712) taken at Carnegie Mellon University. In this course, I learned the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming and design, and exercised these principles through programming assignments in Java.
## Course Overview

This course covered object-oriented programming principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Additionally, the course covered design patterns, software architecture, and best practices for writing maintainable and scalable code.
## Projects

During this course, I completed several projects and assignments that included topics such as:

* Designing and implementing object-oriented programs
* Implementing and using design patterns 
* Developing graphical user interfaces (GUI) using JavaFX
* Working with databases and object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks 
* Understanding and implementing multithreaded programming
* Writing unit tests and using testing frameworks such as JUnit
* Understanding and implementing basic data structures and algorithms

# Skills
Through this course, I have gained the following skills:

* Understanding the principles of object-oriented programming and design
* Implementation of object-oriented design patterns
* Ability to develop GUI applications using JavaFX
* Implementation of multithreaded programming
* Writing and executing unit tests using JUnit
* Understanding of basic data structures and algorithms
